										<h1>My Journey with the BCS BA Foundation Certification</h1>
									</header>

									<p> Sometimes people reach a juncture in their professional life, where they have to make a decision to switch careers due 
										to various circumstances. A similar scenario arose in my life as well. It was critical for me to choose something which
										I was really interested in doing. I was in a phase where I couldn’t choose among the several professions that had a strong 
										overlap with my existing skills. It was then,  a random, yet quite fruitful chat occurred between me and my friend who 
										is a Business Analyst. After the chat and my subsequent research, I finally came to the conclusion of picking Business 
										Analysis (BA) as my next arena. Next, I went to LinkedIn to have a look at the skills of a typical BA job advert. 
										From a brief survey, I realised, a slight brushing of my existing skills and learning of a few additional ones will make
										me an ideal candidate for this profession. But again, I was unsure of where to start. Soon I realised the best way to
										get into the BA field is by getting certified in the Business Analysis Foundation Certificate Exam conducted by the 
										BCS-The Chartered Institute of IT.  Being one of the top certifications and not having a particular prerequisite 
										motivated the decision further. As the first step, I booked my exam with Pearson-Vue a month from my decision date. 
										I wanted to learn and complete the certification in a single month. Now the exam is due, I decided to gather more 
										information and resources to crack it.<p>
	
										<p>I started with the guidelines specified in the BCS website, then some tips from blogs like that of  Amal Naveed and some
										sample questions shown in a YouTube video. These provided a brief idea on how to prepare for the certification. 
										The BCS website also provides links to self-taught and some paid learning options. In my opinion, anyone who is ready
										to spend time and focus on learning materials systematically should opt for self-study. In my self-taught journey, 
										I made sure to finish reading the latest edition of the Business Analysis textbook mentioned on the BCS website. 
										I had prepared a timescale of 2-3 weeks for finishing the book as well as solving sample papers.  After the first skim 
										through the book, I attempted the free specimen paper  on the BCS website and some BA foundation dumps found online. 
										My approach was to solve questions from the start to get an idea and feel for the topics to focus on. I kept 
										highlighting and marking the focus areas so that I could print them to prepare my personal notes. Furthermore, I made 
										sure to read these notes at least once a day and solve as many sample papers as possible. This routine helped me to get 
										familiarised with the important topics as well as the format of the questions. Additionally, I attempted to practise tests 
										through two different courses on Udemy( Foundation Certificate in Business Analysis (ISEB) exams and  BCS Foundation 
										Certificate: Business Analysis Practice Exam) that helped me fill the knowledge gap through repetitive attempts. 
										But unfortunately, the questions in my exams were entirely from different sections than what was focused on these courses. 
										However, my judgement to read the textbook completely helped me to tackle this issue effectively. In my experience, 
										the iterative process of reading and solving questions inculcated an intuitive understanding of the topics, 
										which helped me clear the exam in the first attempt.</p>
   
										<p>So for those who are looking to prepare for the exam by self-study, I would recommend the following tips:</p>
   
										<ul>
										<li>First, book your exam and prepare a time-critical schedule for training.</li>
										<li>Make sure to read the whole Business Analysis latest edition by Debra Paul and James Cadle at least once.</li>
										<li>Prepare your own notes while reading the book.</li>
										<li>Try and create short forms or tactics comfortable for you to remember the sequences of various processes.
										For example, in the case of the problem-solving model, I remembered the steps as “MD-PISA” (Mess finding, Data finding,
										Problem finding, Idea finding, Solution finding, Acceptance finding) and “FAD-DTI”(Feasibility study, Analysis, 
										Design, Development, Testing, Implementation) for the waterfall lifecycle. These acronyms helped me remember all 
										the ordinal status of these processes. In my experience, there were some questions that depended on the chronology 
										of processes.</li>
										<li>Knowing the meaning and definitions of important terminologies will definitely come in handy. For example, you would
										be asked to identify the type of lifecycle or process based on the statement mentioned in the question. </li>
										<li>Solve as many sample multiple-choice questions as possible.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Apart from the tips, the following are some of the topics that I can recollect from my exam:</p>
				   
										<ol>           
										<li>Business Analysis Service Framework.</li>
										<li>Business Analysis Service.</li>
										<li>Variants of the Business Analyst Role.</li>
										<li>T- shaped professional concept.</li>
										<li>Recording Business situations and issues.</li> 
										<li>Key stakeholder management strategies.</li> 
										<li>The example value chain for a sales organisation.</li>
										<li>Elements of a UML activity diagram.</li>
										<li>Analysing the tasks and procedures. ( ‘AS IS’ business processes).</li>
										<li>The gap analysis process.</li>
										<li>Lifecycle for a business case.</li>
										<li>Investment appraisal.</li>
										<li>Actors in RE framework.</li>
										<li>Categories of requirement.</li>
										<li>The generic Agile lifecycle.</li>
										</ol>
					   
										<p>I wish success to everyone attempting the exam. If you have any doubts or questions, please feel free to 
										message me on LinkedIn. I would be more than happy to help.</p>
