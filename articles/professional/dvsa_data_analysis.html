										<h1>A glimpse at the UK driving test data</h1>
									</header>

									<p> I recently booked a driving test to get my UK license. 
                                        These tests are conducted all year round by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) 
                                        at its test centres all over the country. My current driving license is from India and my 
                                        experience with that  test was really good. It was more or less a cakewalk for me and therefore, 
                                        I was pretty confident of clearing the UK driving test in my first attempt. However, amidst  a 
                                        conversation, several of my friends mentioned the level of difficulty of the UK’s driving tests 
                                        and how only a  small margin of drivers clear it in their first attempt. To be honest, this piece of 
                                        information took a slight hit at my confidence. However, before going down the alley filled with 
                                        self-doubts and loss of morale, I decided to take an objective look at the driving tests in the UK. 
                                        Fortunately, the DVSA website provides sufficient data to facilitate my curiosity. These data sets 
                                        contain year-wise data for the total tests conducted and total passes per gender for each of the 
                                        centres. Along with the same, I also gathered some additional datasets specifically for first-time 
                                        test takers, pass rates for automatic vehicles and another indicating their ethnicity. Ethnicity 
                                        data consisted of pass percentage aggregate for each year while first-time test-taker data, in 
                                        addition, contained the number of zero faults made by both genders.<p>
	
                                    <p>A closer look at these data would give me an opportunity to validate the narrative I heard 
                                        from my friends. Therefore, I decided to perform a preliminary analysis using my favourite data 
                                        visualiser - Microsoft Power BI. One of the most interesting elements in Power BI is its ability 
                                        to create interactive dashboards. Further, relations can be easily created between multiple data 
                                        sources to generate quick and meaningful plots that allow dynamic interactions. But, before I delve 
                                        into data cleaning and analysis, it is critical to formulate the objectives and questions that are to 
                                        be answered. I believe creating an Aims grid would provide a concise and focused route map for the 
                                        whole project.</p>

                                    <p>Essentially, I am trying to find if there are other factors besides driving skills that influence the results of a driving test. 
                                        However, the vast data given by DVSA are not in a format suitable for creating plots. So the foremost thing was 
                                        to parse these files and  tabulate the data into a more ‘plottable’ format. I used a python script to do the 
                                        same. It was somewhat a tedious task due to the non-uniform formatting. If the reader is interested in getting my 
                                        pre-processed data, they can get it from here.  With this data, I created  a dashboard to understand it better, 
                                        make relations and consolidate values based on features to bring out conclusive ideas from them. The data required 
                                        for analyses has been allocated into four different tables. The four different tables relate to (1) overall pass 
                                        percentage (2) automatic vehicle pass percentage (3) pass based on gender and ethnicity (4) the number of faults 
                                        in the first time pass again based on gender from 2007-2021 for each of the test centres. </p>

                                    <p> Dashboard 1 is a visual representation of the  overall pass percentage dataset for each of the centres from the year 
                                        2007-2021. The dashboard consists of two slicers and five plots and can be downloaded here. The very first 
                                        slicer is for selecting a particular year, followed by the slicer for each centre. The percentages shown in 
                                        each of the plots are the median of the values for all months in a year. Median was chosen to avoid any 
                                        outliers and to have a robust estimate of the expected pass percentage.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I started by having a look at the median pass percentage of each year for all 
                                        centres combined. This plot will give a clear indication of the nationwide pass percentage and 
                                        also a peek if the agency has relaxed its standard over the years. Further, I plotted the pass 
                                        percentage of both genders separately to see if sex influences the metric. From the plot, we can 
                                        see that the overall pass percentage stayed nearly the same throughout all years and there is 
                                        almost a constant difference between both genders.  The almost constant pass percentage over the 
                                        years indicate that the DVSA standards have been the same for the period considered. Though I 
                                        checked the trend with automatic vehicle pass percentages, I couldn’t find anything different.</p>

                                        <a href="#" class="image"><img src="articles/professional/images/dashboard2.png" alt="Image" height="480" width="950" class="image" /></a>
                                    
                                    <p>Now since I understood that there exists a difference between the pass percentage of men and women,  
                                        I wanted to see if the same trend exists for first-timers as well. I kind of wished for an opposite 
                                        trend for this chart. But to my disappointment, I witnessed the same trend for first-timers as well. 
                                        Throughout the years, the data shows that males outperform females. Additionally, more male drivers 
                                        have managed to pass the driving test in their first attempts with zero faults than female drivers. 
                                        Personally, I feel, one of the reasons for men to outperform women in driving tests might be the 
                                        natural affinity of the gender towards mechanical devices from a young age. Though there still exists 
                                        the prenotion of men being better drivers, the number of female drivers taking the test has increased 
                                        in the past couple of decades. This is evidently seen from the plot given in Figure 2. The drop in 
                                        numbers from the year 2020 is an obvious aftereffect of the pandemic.</p>

                                    <p>Again, being an immigrant in the UK, I got too curious to see whether ethnicity affects the pass 
                                       percentage. To my surprise and relief, there was no  indication in the data of any such differences. 
                                       If we take a closer look at the test data based on ethnicity, the majority of the test takers belong to 
                                       the ‘no preference’ or “prefer not to say” category. Apart from them, the rest of the data looks like an 
                                       equal distribution amongst various ethnicities: i.e., no specific ethnicity is at a disadvantage.</p>

                                       <a href="#" class="image"><img src="articles/professional/images/dashboard3.png" alt="Image" height="480" width="950" class="image" /></a>
                                    
                                    <p>I don’t know why, but the results so far motivated me to see if picking a particular centre would be beneficial. 
                                        Dashboard 2 investigates the answer to this question. Since there are numerous test centres, 
                                        I thought of plotting the data from the top and bottom five centres when sorted based on pass percentage. 
                                        I intended to see if there is a significant difference between the top and bottom five. If there isn't, then 
                                        there is no point in checking for the other centres. I used the ‘Top N’ function in Power BI to filter the data 
                                        for the top and bottom five test centres. I was expecting a trend similar to the national median. But to my 
                                        surprise, the results for the top five centres were 12 percent higher than the national average of 49.8% 
                                        (shown in chart 1 of dashboard 2). However, the bottom 5 had their median pass percentage (50.45%) almost 
                                        equal to the national median. These inferences led me to include the population density for each region into 
                                        the existing data for the 10 centres. This would help deduce if there is any correlation between the population 
                                        density and the pass percentages. My thought was if there are fewer people, then correspondingly traffic and the 
                                        number of junctions will also be less. This reduction would mean that driving in these places may be relatively easy. </p>

                                    <p>The top five centres include Llandrindod (20 persons per sq km), Malton (2937per sq km), 
                                        Whitby (875.4 per sq km), Dorchester (133 per sq km), Brecon (25 per sq km). The bottom five test 
                                        centres included Gairloch (220.9 per sq km), Dorchester county town (13 per sq km), Oxford (Kassam Stadium, 
                                        3270 per sq km), Halifax Maltings (1077 per sq km), Inverness (Longman drive, 2958.2 per sq km). It can be 
                                        seen that the top and bottom five, both contain high and low populated regions. Hence, it cannot be conclusively 
                                        said whether there is a correlation between pass percentage and population density in the region of the test 
                                        centres. Further, when we plot the graph for pass percentages in the first attempt throughout years it shows a 
                                        somewhat straight line with an overlap of both the genders. So I am still curious about the possible difference 
                                        from the national median. This led me to check if the test-taking month had any influence on the pass percentage. 
                                        However, I was not able to find any such trend based on the months. Though there was a drop in percentage in 
                                        February for all  top five centres, the rest of the year looked more or less the same. Similarly, for the bottom 
                                        five, test-taking month never influenced the outcome. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>In short, the dashboards were created to fulfil each of the objectives stated in the AIMS Grid as 
                                        well as provide a broad perspective on the driving test results based on various factors. 
                                        The other benefit of the interactive characteristic is that the stakeholders can retrieve data 
                                        and visualisation based on specific years and centres from the dashboard. The object introspection
                                        shows that the stories I heard were true and are now backed with evidence. The whole process has
                                        made me more mindful of the challenges in the UK driving test. Irrespective of the results 
                                        obtained, I strongly believe extra efforts and proper guidance from a great instructor will help 
                                        one go that extra mile and clear the test.</p>
